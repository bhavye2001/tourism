        The Masjid-i Jehan Numa (lit. the 'World-reflecting Mosque' or "Mosque of the Celestial Sphere"), commonly known as the Jama Masjid of Delhi, is one of the largest mosques in India.

It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656 at a cost of one million rupees, and was inaugurated by Imam Syed Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari from Bukhara. The mosque was completed in 1656 AD with three great gates and two 40 metres high minarets constructed with strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25000 people. There are three domes on the terrace which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total of 899 black borders are marked for worshippers. The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore is similar to the Jama Masjid.</p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts on Jama Masjid </h2>
        <p><strong>#1 At that Time, Jama Masjid Cost Around One Million Rupees </strong></p>
        <p>Yes, you heard it right. Jama Masjid’s approximate costing was calculated to be around one million rupees at that time. The whole design and infrastructure were done during Shah Jahan’s rule, under the supervision of Saadullah Khan who was the Wazir during Jahan’s reign.</p>
        <p><strong>#2 More than 5000 Workers were Involved </strong></p>
        <p>Clearing people’s doubt, Jama Masjid was constructed with the help of more than 5000 workers at that time. An enormous force was hired by Shah Jahan that ensured the creation of this mosque or monument, whatever you want to call it. Imam Bukhari, a Muslim priest from Bukhara inaugurated the mosque on the invitation from Shah Jahan.</p>
        <p><strong>#3 British Wanted to Destroy Jama Masjid </strong></p>
        <p>After winning the revolt of 1857, the British seized the mosque by settling and stationing their soldiers here. According to sources, the British carried a deep desire to destroy this mosque for punishing the people of the city. But due to strong opposition by the local people, British were unable to do it and hence Jama Masjid survived and became one of the most historic monuments available in India.</p>

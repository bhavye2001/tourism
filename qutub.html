        <h2><b>About</b></h2>
        <p>
        The Qutb Minar, also spelled as Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of New Delhi, India. The height of Qutb Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. The tower tapers, and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.

Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.[8] The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general minarets were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist</p>

        <b>#</b>
        Standing tall at 73 m, the Qutub Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        <br>
        <b>#</b>
         It is considered to be the Tower of Victory, built by Qutubuddin Aibak in the 12th century to mark the end of rule by the last Hindu Kingdom.
        <br>
        <b>#</b>
       The Qutub Minar was built in three stages by three rulers of Delhi (Qutab-ud-din Aibak built one storey followed by his successor, Shams-ud-din Iltutmishwho built three storeys more and finally Firoze Shah Tughlak who built the final and fifth storey) and was finally completed in the 14th century, maybe that’s why it tilts a little!
        <br>
        <b>#</b>
         There is a mosque called Quwwat-Ul-Islam, built in the same compound as the minaret. Though in ruins, it is noted to be the first mosque built in India.
